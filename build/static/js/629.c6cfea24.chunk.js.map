This experience has not only exposed me to the latest\n            beauty techniques available in the market but also to invaluable\n            industry insights—what works, what doesn’t, and how to provide the\n            best advice to women seeking to become the most beautiful versions\n            of themselves without overspending.<br></br>\n            <br></br>Through my journey, I have come to understand what people\n            need to look and feel their best amidst their busy lives. Eyelash\n            extensions, for example, offer a perfect solution for those of us\n            who are always on the go. The facial treatments I provide also\n            simplify skincare routines, saving precious time without sacrificing\n            results.<br></br>\n            <br></br>At Arden, beauty and ethics go hand in hand. I use\n            non-toxic or minimally harsh chemicals and avoid animal by-products\n            whenever possible, ensuring my services are suitable for vegans,\n            individuals with sensitive skin, and those concerned about the\n            environment.<br></br>\n            <br></br>My inspiration stems from childhood memories of\n            accompanying my mom to a home-based salon in a nearby HDB flat. The\n            warmth, laughter, and simplicity of those visits left a lasting\n            impression on me. It made me question why I should pay higher rent\n            and charge my clients more when I can offer them an equally, if not\n            more, personal and heartfelt experience.<br></br>\n            <br></br>The quality of my work is never compromised, even in a more\n            intimate setting.<br></br>\n            <br></br>I take great joy in creating a serene environment where my\n            clients can relax and rejuvenate while enhancing their natural\n            beauty with soft, light synthetic lashes.<br></br>\n            <br></br>My hope is that every client who visits Arden leaves not\n            only looking good but also feeling refreshed and at peace after\n            their time spent with us.\n          </p>\n        </AccordionItem>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default CarOptionsSection;\n"],"names":["AccordionItem","_ref","title","children","isOpen","setIsOpen","useState","_jsx","style","display","justifyContent","alignItems","_jsxs","marginTop","border","borderRadius","overflow","background","flexDirection","width","onClick","className","padding","textAlign","transition","fontSize","color","fontWeight","transform","marginLeft","maxHeight","CarOptionsSection","maxWidth","margin","marginBottom"],"sourceRoot":""}
